# My Machine Learning Zoomcamp Journey 🚀

Hi! I'm Ugurcan Uzunkaya. This repository serves as a portfolio of my work during the **[Machine Learning Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/machine-learning-zoomcamp)**, a comprehensive 4-month course by DataTalks.Club focused on Machine Learning Engineering.

Here, I document my learning process, including code solutions for homework assignments, personal notes, and end-to-end projects.

## 📂 What's Inside?

*   **`homeworks/`**: Contains my solutions for the weekly assignments.
    *   **HW1 - HW4**: Regression, Classification, and Evaluation Metrics.
    *   **HW5**: Deep Learning with PyTorch (Hair Type Classification).
*   **`notes/`**: My personal study notes and key takeaways from the lectures.
*   **`projects/`**: (Coming Soon) Midterm and Capstone projects where I apply what I've learned to real-world datasets.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

I am building skills in:
*   **Python Data Stack**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
*   **Machine Learning**: Scikit-Learn, XGBoost
*   **Deep Learning**: TensorFlow, PyTorch
*   **Deployment**: Docker, Flask/FastAPI, Kubernetes, AWS

## 📈 Progress
