# Homework 4: Evaluation Metrics for Classification

This folder contains the solution for Homework 4.

## Task Description

The goal is to evaluate the Lead Scoring classification model using various metrics.
Key steps:
1.  Data preparation (split with simple split).
2.  ROC AUC analysis (feature importance).
3.  Training Logistic Regression.
4.  Precision-Recall analysis (intersection point).
5.  F1 Score analysis (max point).
6.  k-Fold Cross-Validation.
7.  Hyperparameter Tuning (finding best `C`).

For more details, see [hw4_task.md](hw4_task.md).
