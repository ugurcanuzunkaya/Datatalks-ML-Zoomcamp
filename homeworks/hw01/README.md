# Homework 1: Intro to Machine Learning

This folder contains the solution for Homework 1 of the DataTalks.Club Machine Learning Zoomcamp.

## Task Description

The goal of this homework is to get familiar with the environment, Pandas, and basic data manipulation.
The task involves:
1.  Checking Pandas version.
2.  Loading the Car Fuel Efficiency dataset.
3.  Answering questions about the dataset (records count, fuel types, missing values).
4.  Performing basic calculations (max values, median, mode).
5.  Implementing a simple linear regression calculation using NumPy.

for more details, see [hw1_task.md](hw1_task.md).

## Files

- `Datatalks - ML Zoomcamp - HW1.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and answers.
- `hw1_task.md`: The original homework instructions.

## Usage

To run the notebook:

1.  Ensure you have the environment set up (see root README).
2.  Launch Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
3.  Open `Datatalks - ML Zoomcamp - HW1.ipynb` and execute the cells.

## Setup

Download the dataset:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexeygrigorev/datasets/master/car_fuel_efficiency.csv
```
(Note: The notebook handles data loading, but you can download it manually if needed).
